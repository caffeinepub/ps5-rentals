  "summary": "Mixpanel token appears updated in frontend/index.html and the snippet is located in the <head>, but the Mixpanel loader snippet shown in the diff looks syntactically corrupted/truncated (likely causing runtime errors), and additional unrequested analytics-related logic (Contentsquare verification) was added.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Update the Mixpanel tracking snippet in frontend/index.html to use the exact script content provided by the user (including mixpanel.init('da58e366649ab3a9c5b1fc49681f9d76', { autocapture: true, record_sessions_percent: 100, })) and ensure the app builds/loads without console errors caused by the Mixpanel snippet.",
      "reason": "The Mixpanel bootstrap/loader code in the diff appears to contain a broken expression (\"file:\"===) which would likely produce a JavaScript syntax error, violating the acceptance criterion about no console errors and making it unlikely to match the exact provided snippet content.",

      "description": "Added a Contentsquare verification utility that checks whether the Contentsquare script loaded and logs success/failure messages, and wired it to run on app startup.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly scoped changes to updating the Mixpanel snippet/token and stated not to add/change other analytics provider configuration; this adds new behavior related to Contentsquare beyond keeping its snippet intact.",

        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (mentions frontend/src/utils/contentsquareVerification.ts and frontend/src/main.tsx running verification on startup)"
